title: Mistakes, Part 1
---

Back when I studied physics, I had a friend who lost a lot of work by trying to type

```
% rm *.o
```

and instead typing

```
% rm * .o
```

That one extra character make such a difference.

I took this to heart in my own software career by using
[make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_\(software\)) or equivalents where
available. When I accidentally type

```
$ make claen
make: *** No rule to make target `claen'.  Stop.
$
```

We can quantify the number of typos I'd have to make in a command via an [edit
distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance). In the `rm *.o`
example, the edit distance between success and catastrophe is 1.

Imagine the chaos that would ensue if Unix had an `sl` command that did
anything untoward. `dc` is bad enough.
